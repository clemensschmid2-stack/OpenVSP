This fork is derived from NASA's OpenVSP project.

- Made the bundled CMinpack configuration work with multi-configuration CMake
  generators by defaulting its otherwise-empty `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`.
- Replaced Code-Eli's locale-sensitive Windows date parsing during its dependency
  patch step with CMake's portable timestamp function.
- Escaped libxml's native Windows configuration path in its generated CMake
  script, preserving the backslashes required by its legacy batch installer.
- Pointed OpenABF at Eigen's installed CMake package directory.
- Generated OpenVSP's build date with CMake instead of parsing localized shell
  output, preventing malformed version headers on non-English Windows systems.
- Propagated the active configuration to the superproject's install and package
  steps so Visual Studio Release builds do not fall back to Debug.
- Forwarded an explicitly selected SWIG executable from the superproject to the
  OpenVSP build so API wrappers are not silently skipped.
- Ignored the local `build-msvc` and `build-msvc-full` output directories.
- Added the unmodified official OpenVSP 3.51.2 Windows/Python 3.13 distribution
  under `reference_builds` as a behavioral parity baseline.
- Added `build_openvsp.py` and its batch launcher for a reproducible full
  Visual Studio 2022 x64 build, including the GUI, VSPAERO, tools, docs, and
  Python API wrapper.
- Added black-box parity tests comparing official and local VSPAERO thin/thick
  base and stability results with configurable floating-point tolerances.
